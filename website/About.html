        <p>" i started my crypto adventure in 2016 by buying my first amount of bitcoin. I forgot that i bought it and after i came back to my portfolio 
            2 years later , i saw that the price of bitcoin went up ALOT. I sold a bit and started investing in other projects like ethereum. After a lot
            of learning about crypto i started daytrading , and at that point my portfolio went bigger and bigger and it became my passion. "
